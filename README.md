shopify-custom-fields
=====================

A javascript tool to emulate Custom Fields within the Shopify dashboard. The tool shows the fields based on metafields that would have been created. There's no interface for the Store Owner to make any new fields (simply to avoid explosions) so it's up to the developer to help add them.

To make new ones you'll need to either use [ShopifyFD](http://shopify.freakdesign.com.au/), or a metafield app of your choice. 

Installation
------------

Use the [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-fields-for-shopify/alfplfpobekffinigeidgmmfjollghln). It loads the files from here, but you can always just run from a [bookmarklet](https://rawgithub.com/freakdesign/shopify-custom-fields/master/installation.html) and drag the link into the browser bookmark bar. if your prefer (useful if you don't use chrome).


To do
-----

* Add custom fields to pages and articles. Currently it only on products.
