shopify-custom-fields
=====================

A javascript tool to emulate Custom Fields within the Shopify dashboard. The tool shows the fields based on metafields that would have been created. There's no interface for the Store Owner to make any new fields (simply to avoid explosions) so it's up to the developer to help add them.

To make new ones you'll need to either use [ShopifyFD](http://shopify.freakdesign.com.au/), or a metafield app of your choice. 

Installation
------------

Use the [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-fields-for-shopify/alfplfpobekffinigeidgmmfjollghln).
