shopify-custom-fields
=====================

This a javascript tool to emulate Custom Fields within the Shopify dashboard. The tool shows fields based on pre-existing metafields. 

Do note that there's no interface for the Store Owner to make any new fields using this (simply to avoid explosions) so it's up to the developer to help add them.

To add the required metafields you'll need to either use [ShopifyFD](http://shopify.freakdesign.com.au/), the Shopify API, or a metafield app of your choice. 


Installation
------------

tl;dr Use the [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-fields-for-shopify/alfplfpobekffinigeidgmmfjollghln).

The Chrome Extension is simply a help script that loads the files from here. If you don't run Chrome or just prefer to load via a bookmarklet you can follow the notes on [this page](https://rawgithub.com/freakdesign/shopify-custom-fields/master/installation.html).


To do
-----

* Add custom fields to pages and articles.
